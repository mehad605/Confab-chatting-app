# Chat App - Main Page

Welcome to the README for the main page of the Chat App developed as a 3rd-year university project using Flutter and Firebase. This page serves as the entry point for the application, orchestrating the initialization of Firebase, user authentication, and navigation through the app.

## Introduction

The `main.dart` file is the heart of the Chat App, responsible for initializing Firebase, setting up providers, and defining the application's theme and routes.

## Features

- Firebase Initialization
- Navigation between login, registration, and home pages
- Themed UI for a pleasant user experience

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Chat App:

1. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Set up Firebase for your project and replace the configurations in `firebase_options.dart`.
4. Run the app using `flutter run`.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies for this page include:

- `firebase_auth` for Firebase authentication
- `provider` for state management

## File Structure

- `main.dart`: Entry point of the application, orchestrating initialization and routing.
- `firebase_options.dart`: Firebase configurations.
- `services`: Directory containing various services like `navigation_service` and `database_service`.
- `providers`: Directory containing the `AuthenticationProvider` for managing user authentication.
- `api`: Directory containing the `firebase_api` for Firebase-related functionalities.
- `pages`: Directory containing the different pages of the application.

## Usage

- The app starts with the `SplashPage`, which initializes Firebase and transitions to `MainApp`.
- `MainApp` sets up providers and defines the overall theme.
- Users are directed to the login page (`LoginPage`), where they can sign in or navigate to the registration page (`RegisterPage`).
- Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page (`HomePage`).

# Firebase Options Configuration

## Overview

This file, `firebase_options.dart`, is an essential component of the Flutter-based chat application, responsible for configuring Firebase options. Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Firebase, Inc. This configuration file ensures that the appropriate Firebase options are set based on the target platform (web, Android, etc.).

## How to Use

To integrate Firebase with your app, you can use the provided `DefaultFirebaseOptions` class. Below is an example of how to initialize Firebase using the default options:

```dart
import 'firebase_options.dart';

await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);

static const FirebaseOptions android = FirebaseOptions(
  apiKey: 'YOUR_ANDROID_API_KEY',
  appId: 'YOUR_ANDROID_APP_ID',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_ANDROID_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
  projectId: 'YOUR_ANDROID_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_ANDROID_STORAGE_BUCKET',
);
```

This file is autogenerated by connecting the firebase project to the flutter project using firebase cli.

# Chat App Project - TopBar Widget

This document describes the `TopBar` widget, a custom widget created for the chat application. The widget is designed to be reusable across various pages of the application, providing a consistent user interface element.

## Structure and Functionality

The `TopBar` widget is a stateless widget, meaning it describes part of the user interface which can depend on configuration information in the constructor and the build context, but does not depend on any mutable state.

### Properties

The `TopBar` widget accepts the following parameters:

- `_barTitle`: A string representing the title of the bar.
- `primaryAction`: An optional widget representing the primary action button.
- `secondaryAction`: An optional widget representing the secondary action button.
- `fontSize`: An optional double representing the font size of the title. Defaults to 35.

These parameters allow for customization of the top bar according to the needs of each page.

### Construction

The `TopBar` widget is constructed using the `TopBar()` constructor. It calculates the device height and width using the `MediaQuery` class to ensure the top bar fits appropriately on different screen sizes.

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Container` widget that represents the top bar. The container's height is set to 10% of the device height, ensuring it doesn't take up too much space on the screen. The width is set to the full device width, allowing the top bar to span the entire width of the screen.

The container holds a `Row` widget, which arranges its children in a horizontal array. The `mainAxisAlignment` property is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween`, which means the children (i.e., the secondary action, title, and primary action) are spread evenly across the row.

The children of the row are conditionally rendered based on whether they are null. This allows for flexibility in adding or removing actions from the top bar.

The title is represented by a `Text` widget, which displays the `_barTitle` string. The `TextOverflow.ellipsis` property is used to handle cases where the title string is too long to fit within the available space.

## Usage

To use this widget, simply instantiate it with the desired parameters. Here's an example:

```dart
TopBar(
 'Chat Page',
 primaryAction: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.add), onPressed: () {}),
 secondaryAction: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.settings), onPressed: () {}),
)
```

This would create a top bar with the title "Chat Page", and an add button on the far left and a settings button on the far right.

# Chat App Project - RoundedImage Widgets

This document describes three custom widgets created for the chat application: `RoundedImageNetwork`, `RoundedImageFile`, and `RoundedImageNetworkWithStatusIndicator`. These widgets are designed to display images with rounded corners, either from a network source or from a local file.

## RoundedImageNetwork

`RoundedImageNetwork` is a stateless widget that displays an image from a network source. The image is loaded using the `NetworkImage` class and displayed within a `Container` widget with rounded corners.

The `RoundedImageNetwork` widget accepts the following parameters:

- `imagePath`: A string representing the URL of the image.
- `size`: A double representing the size of the image.

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Container` widget that contains the image. The image is displayed using a `DecorationImage` widget, which loads the image from the network and fits it within the container. The `BorderRadius` property is used to create the rounded corners.

## RoundedImageFile

`RoundedImageFile` is similar to `RoundedImageNetwork`, but it displays an image from a local file instead of a network source. The image is loaded using the `AssetImage` class and displayed within a `Container` widget with rounded corners.

### Properties

The `RoundedImageFile` widget accepts the following parameters:

- `image`: A `PlatformFile` object representing the image file.
- `size`: A double representing the size of the image.

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Container` widget that contains the image. The image is displayed using a `DecorationImage` widget, which loads the image from the file and fits it within the container. The `BorderRadius` property is used to create the rounded corners.

## RoundedImageNetworkWithStatusIndicator

`RoundedImageNetworkWithStatusIndicator` is a subclass of `RoundedImageNetwork` that adds a status indicator to the bottom right of the image. The status indicator is a small colored circle that changes color based on the `isActive` boolean property.

### Properties

The `RoundedImageNetworkWithStatusIndicator` widget accepts the following parameters:

- `imagePath`: A string representing the URL of the image.
- `size`: A double representing the size of the image.
- `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the status indicator should be green (active) or red (inactive).

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Stack` widget that overlays the status indicator on top of the image. The status indicator is a `Container` widget with a `BorderRadius` property to create the rounded corners, and its color is determined by the `isActive` property.

# Chat App Project - Message Bubble Widgets

This document describes two custom widgets created for the chat application: `TextMessageBubble` and `ImageMessageBubble`. These widgets are designed to display chat messages, either as text or as an image, with a unique design for the sender's own messages.

- `message`: A `ChatMessage` object containing the message data.
- `height`: A double representing the height of the message bubble.
- `width`: A double representing the width of the message bubble.

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Container` widget that contains the message content and sent time. The message content is displayed using a `Text` widget, and the sent time is displayed using another `Text` widget. The `Column` widget is used to arrange these two elements vertically.

The `Container` widget has a gradient background that uses a different color scheme depending on whether the message is owned by the current user. The gradient starts at the center left for the sender's messages and at the center right for other messages.

## ImageMessageBubble

`ImageMessageBubble` is a stateless widget that displays an image-based chat message. The message content (which is assumed to be a URL pointing to an image) and sent time are displayed within a `Container` widget with rounded corners and a gradient background.

### Properties

The `ImageMessageBubble` widget accepts the same parameters as `TextMessageBubble`.

### Build Method

The `build` method returns a `Container` widget that contains the message content and sent time. The message content is displayed using a `Container` widget with a `DecorationImage` widget that loads the image from the URL. The sent time is displayed using a `Text` widget.

Like `TextMessageBubble`, the `Container` widget has a gradient background that uses a different color scheme depending on whether the message is owned by the current user. The gradient starts at the bottom left for the sender's messages and at the top right for other messages.

# Chat App Project - CustomListViewTileWithActivity Widget

## Build Method

The `build` method returns a `GestureDetector` widget that wraps around a `Container` widget. The `GestureDetector` widget is used to detect tap gestures on the list tile. When the list tile is tapped, the `onTap` function is called.

The `Container` widget contains a `Row` widget, which arranges its children in a horizontal array. The children of the row include:

- An image displayed within a `Container` widget with rounded corners. The image is loaded using the `NetworkImage` class.
- A column of `Text` widgets displaying the title and subtitle of the list tile.
- An activity indicator, which is a small circular `Container` widget. The color of the activity indicator depends on the `isActive` parameter.
- The text associated with the activity indicator, which is displayed only if `isActivity` is true.

The `Container` widget has a white background color and rounded corners. It also has padding and margin to provide spacing between the list tile and its neighbors.```
